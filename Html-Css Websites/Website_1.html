  <h1>Ancient Legends and the History of the Holiday's Origins</h1>
  <p><span style="color: orange;">The first mentions of Halloween</span> date back to the 16th century, as it was based on the pagan Samhain festival, which was associated with death, the afterlife, and the supernatural, and was celebrated by the Celts. Over time, Samhain was celebrated throughout the British Isles. In the 19th-20th centuries, the holiday began to fade, and a more modern version—Halloween—emerged, traditionally considered <span style="color: orange;">All Saints' Day.</span></p>
  <p><span style="color: orange;">Halloween originated from Samhain.</span> The Celts believed that <span style="color: orange;">October 31st was the only night of the year</span> when the veil between the world of the living and the dead was thinnest. On the night of Samhain, they wore masks to hide from the spirits, left treats on doorsteps to appease them, and carved faces in pumpkins to honor the spirits. Samhain had been banished many centuries ago.</p>
  <p>The word <span style="color: orange;">"Samhain"</span> is rarely heard in movies and TV shows. Interestingly, it sometimes turns out to be a proper name. In the "Supernatural" TV show episode titled "It's the Great Pumpkin, Sam Winchester," Samhain is <span style="color: orange;">the name of a demon</span> whose fear inspired all the Samhain and Halloween rituals.</p>
  <p>In the animated series <span style="color: orange;">"Real Ghostbusters"</span>, Samhain is an evil personification of Halloween with a pumpkin for a head. In the <span style="color: orange;">Hack/Slash</span> comic series (not to be confused with the anime of the same name), Samhain is the name of an agent in the <span style="color: orange;">"Society of the Black Lantern"</span> who worships "slashers" (demons). In the <span style="color: orange;">King's Quest</span> video game series, Samhain is known as the King of the Dead.</p>
  <p><span style="color: orange;">Samhain has surprisingly poor vision for a demon.</span> He sees the world as blurry, and people dressed in costumes and masks appear to him as dead. As a result, <span style="color: orange;">Samhain walks past them</span> without attacking.</p>
  <p><span style="color: orange;">Jack-O'-Lantern</span> — traditionally made from a pumpkin, though <span style="color: orange;">during Samhain</span>, lanterns were carved from turnips. The pumpkin, being a cheaper and more accessible vegetable, became the preferred choice in the United States starting in the 19th century. The process is simple—guts are removed from the pumpkin, a frightening face is carved into it, and a lit candle is placed inside. When the Jack-O'-Lantern is lit at night, it creates the illusion of a spirit staring at the person with its fiery eyes. This lantern serves as a guide to souls returning from purgatory.</p>
  
  <h1>History</h1>
  <hr />
  <p>When Samhain ruled the Earth, <span style="color: orange;">one night each year belonged to him.</span> On Halloween, people <span style="color: orange;">hid in their homes and wore masks</span> so that Samhain wouldn't see them. They placed pumpkins with carved faces in their yards and left treats by the door to appease Samhain.</p>
  <p>In 1408, <span style="color: orange;">Samhain was banished to Hell</span> by an unknown force. However, his witch lover and her brother, who worshiped him, remained on Earth. They later became known as Tracy Davis and Don Harding.</p>
  <p>Once every <span style="color: orange;">600 years</span>, a ritual can be performed to release Samhain from Hell. For this ritual, two powerful witches must offer <span style="color: orange;">three sacrifices over three days,</span> with the last one occurring on Halloween.</p>
  <p>Unfortunately, Halloween <span style="color: orange;">2021 is the year</span> when the ritual can be performed to release Samhain from Hell...</p>
